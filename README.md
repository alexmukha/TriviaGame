# Trivia Game

This game is built on a basic HTML and JavaScript. Styled with Bootstrap and minor customized CSS.
With the help of Open Trivia DB API and jQuery this code is able to populate an array of questions and answers.
With the initial loading of the page an array is pre-loaded with questions and answers from Open Trivia DB. The difficulty level is set to “easy” while topic theme is set to “random” increasing the difficultly level.
When a START button is pressed, answers are displayed with questions randomly assigned to each of the four buttons. Starting over the game will let you use the same questions while answers will be shuffled to avoid repeating same positioning. In order to get a new set of questions the whole page needs to be refreshed or restarted. 

                Have fun! Good Luck!
